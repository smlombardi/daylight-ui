### Install

This theme is installed by default with Atom and can be activated by going to the __Settings > Themes__ section and selecting "One Light" from the __UI Themes__ drop-down menu.

### Settings

In the theme settings you can switch between 3 layout modes:

1. `Auto` (default) - In Auto mode, the UI and font size will automatically change based on the window size.
2. `Compact` - The UI stays compact to leave more space for the editor.
3. `Spacious` - The UI is expanded, giving some breathing room.

### Customize

You can scale the whole UI up or down by adding this to your `styles.less`:

```css
.theme-one-light-ui { font-size: 14px; }
```

It's also possible to only change certain areas (Use the DevTools to find the right selectors):

```css
.theme-one-light-ui {
  .tab-bar { font-size: 18px; }
  .tree-view { font-size: 14px; }
  .status-bar { font-size: 12px; }
}
```

### FAQ

__Why do the colors change when I switch Syntax themes.__
This UI theme uses the same background color as the choosen Syntax theme. In case that Syntax theme has a dark background color, it only uses its hue, but otherwise stays light. This lets you use light-dark combos.
