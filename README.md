## Daylight UI theme

A theme based on One Light that offers a light-on-dark tree view and is otherwise all shades of gray.

It's designed to be used with light syntax themes, such as my [Inspired Github theme.](https://github.com/smlombardi/inspired-github)

As a first pass, it's likely to have some issues, so please report. Enjoy.
